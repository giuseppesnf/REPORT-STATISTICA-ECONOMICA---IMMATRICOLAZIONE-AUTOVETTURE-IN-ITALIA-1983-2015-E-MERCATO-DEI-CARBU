This reporting data analysis work primarily involved building a database containing as dependent variable the increase in the number of car registrations in Italy during the last thirty years and as independent and control variables the price of petrol and diesel, the average income of Italian families, the tariffs relating to vehicles insurance and other indicators. After that, using classical analysis tools like correlation test and the regression model, the variables most related to car registrations were taken into consideration and, subsequently, forecasts for the next 5 years were made. In addition, taking into account the fact that Italy is one of the countries with the highest fuel price in the world, technical considerations were also made on the historical series relating to the fuel market in recent years and, finally, it was analyzed how this negatively affected the choices of Italian families regarding the purchase of cars.
